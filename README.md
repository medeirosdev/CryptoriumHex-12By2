The first database is used to store the raw data before it is encrypted, while the second database is used to store the encrypted data after it has been processed through the 12 layers of encryption. The two databases are kept separate to further enhance the security of the data, as it prevents any potential attacker from accessing both the raw and encrypted data at the same time.

The 12 layers of encryption used in this algorithm are specifically designed to make it extremely difficult for any unauthorized party to crack the encryption and gain access to the data. Each layer of encryption introduces a new level of complexity, making it virtually impossible for even the most advanced computing systems to break through all 12 layers.

In summary, CryptoriumHex-12By2 is a highly secure encryption algorithm that uses 12 layers of encryption barriers and two separate databases to protect sensitive data. Its use of TypeScript ensures scalability and reliability, making it a strong choice for developers looking for a secure encryption solution.
