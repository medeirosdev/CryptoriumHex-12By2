## CryptoriumHex-12By2
CryptoriumHex-12By2 is a cryptography application that uses 9 different ciphers randomly selected to encrypt data. The sequence of ciphers used is stored in MongoDB, while the data is stored in MySQL. The application was developed using TypeScript, Express, various ciphers, Mongoose, and Sequelize.

## Security
Security is a top concern of CryptoriumHex-12By2. All ciphers used are secure and have been tested to ensure that there are no known vulnerabilities. In addition, the sequence of ciphers used is stored in MongoDB, ensuring that it is not easily accessible by third parties.

The use of different ciphers also increases security by making the decoding process much more difficult. Even if one cipher is compromised, the other layers of encryption will still provide protection to the data.

## Usability
CryptoriumHex-12By2 is easy to use and can be used by anyone, regardless of their level of experience in cryptography. The user only needs to send the data to be encrypted, and the application will do everything else automatically.

In addition, the application features an intuitive and user-friendly interface, which allows the user to manually select the cipher option. This gives the user greater control over the encryption process.

## Ease of Use
Ease of use is another advantage of CryptoriumHex-12By2. The application was developed with the intention of being easy to use and configure. To get started with the application, simply follow these steps:

- Install project dependencies with the command npm install
- Set up the necessary environment variables for connecting to MongoDB and MySQL
- Start the application with the command npm start
## Technologies
CryptoriumHex-12By2 was developed using the following technologies:

- TypeScript - a programming language that adds static typing features to JavaScript
- Express - a framework for creating web applications in Node.js
- Various ciphers - AES, Blowfish, Twofish, RC4, DES, TripleDES, RSA, ElGamal, and ECC
- Mongoose - a MongoDB library that provides an abstraction layer for data modeling
- Sequelize - a Node.js ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) that supports multiple SQL databases
## Conclusion
CryptoriumHex-12By2 is a secure, easy-to-use, and easy-to-configure cryptography application. By using different ciphers, the application provides an additional layer of security and makes the decoding process much more difficult. The use of technologies such as TypeScript, Express, Mongoose, and Sequelize also make the application more robust and scalable.
